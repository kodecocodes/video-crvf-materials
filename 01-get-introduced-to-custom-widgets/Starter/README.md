# Yogacast

A demo project for showing how to build custom reusable widgets

Here are a few points about how this demo is set up:

- An MVVM architecture is used to communicate with the AudioWidget. See [this article](https://medium.com/flutter-community/a-beginners-guide-to-architecting-a-flutter-app-1e9053211a74) for a more detailed description.
- You can use any audio plugin you like, but this demo uses the [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) plugin.
